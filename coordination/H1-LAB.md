# H1 Lab — relevant, concrete, memorable

**Scope:** Use for a NEW or substantially rewritten H1 on an important commercial/service/landing page. This process ships with the exported Astro site and needs no external knowledge base. A small copy correction does not trigger a headline contest.

## Inputs (use the current site, not generic templates)

- Page role, actual offer/service, primary buyer and the ONE main decision/action.
- Primary search intent and buyer-recognizable words; GSC/search and competitor evidence when available and proportionate. Avoid competing with another page on the same intent.
- Concrete customer outcome, relevant proof/process, real constraints and geography where applicable.
- Current `coordination/CONTENT-TONE.json`, `CONTENT-VOICE-PROFILE.md` and approved project facts.
- Relevant BusinessIntelligence research **when accessible and useful**; never require a private repository to export, build or edit a standalone site.

## Per-page Hero tone (Pages CMS)

The `hero.toneOverrides` object may be set on **each page**, independently of global `coordination/CONTENT-TONE.json`. Controls exist for `eyebrowPreset`, `titlePreset` (H1), `supportPreset`, `primaryCtaPreset` and `secondaryCtaPreset`. Each field resolves separately:

1. A selected named preset on that Hero part wins.
2. Missing, empty or `inherit` follows the site's `heroPreset`.
3. If site `heroPreset` is `inherit`, use the site's `defaultPreset`.

Read the current CMS-backed page JSON, `coordination/CONTENT-TONE.json`, `CONTENT-VOICE-PROFILE.md` and `COPY-STYLE.md` immediately before writing. Keep H1 Lab's relevance, concrete value, truth and independent readability gates even with an expressive tone. CTA labels stay unmistakably actionable; proof data and image alt are factual, not creative tone controls.

**Editorial preference only:** Changing a dropdown does not regenerate or publish text, change rendered HTML, open a content queue or overwrite OWNER-edited copy. Apply the effective per-part tone when next explicitly asked to write/rewrite that part. When testing alternative SEO Heroes, prefer isolated draft/test fixtures over multiple public same-intent `/seo` variants. New public pages require their own distinct search intent and sitemap decision.

## Non-negotiable H1 gates

Read the H1 **alone**, with eyebrow, subheading, images and logo hidden.

1. **SEO / relevance:** A buyer searching for the intended service/question should recognize the subject and intent. On high-intent service pages, normally identify the service/category directly. Natural language beats mechanical keyword repetition.
2. **AIO / meaning:** The heading accurately labels the question, service or answer the page genuinely provides. It must not imply AI ranking, citations or claims the page cannot support.
3. **CRO / buyer value:** State a meaningful result, problem solved, decision or offer. The user should know why this page matters. Don't substitute vague promises for real value or make every informational article a hard sell.
4. **Content Voice / distinction:** Be direct and specific enough to remember; use the site's chosen tone where it helps. Cleverness alone does not count; a plain, excellent service H1 beats an abstract slogan.
5. **Truth / clarity:** Instantly understandable and consistent with the actual offer, proof and page. Reject empty words like “løsninger som tar deg videre” that could describe any company.

A **critical failure in relevance, standalone clarity, buyer value or truth disqualifies** the candidate. Do not average a weak SEO/AIO H1 against a strong CRO or Voice score. The eyebrow/subheading should *reinforce* a strong H1, never rescue an unclear one.

## Workflow by change size

- **A — ordinary copy fix:** preserve existing H1 and page intent unless specifically asked to change them; no research or variants.
- **B — substantial H1/section revision:** make 2–3 meaningfully different candidates if needed, choose one that passes the gates.
- **C — new important page / core service Hero:** use the page's short Page Contract, explore roughly 6–10 genuinely distinct angles internally (straight service, buyer result, problem → solution, useful contrast, clear offer). Discard invalid ones; present **up to three finalists**, one recommendation and one-sentence trade-offs. Do not generate arbitrary quotas if the answer is already clear.

After choosing the H1, assemble eyebrow (category/relevance), subheading (explain offer/process), proof (believability) and CTA (natural next step). Check the complete Hero and heading-only story; never make the user guess what is being sold. Use Value Equation to diagnose credibility, delay and effort on the **whole page**, not to stuff four promises into H1.

## Quick red-team

- **Three-second test:** What is this page about and why should the target visitor care?
- **Isolation test:** Would the H1 work without supporting Hero elements?
- **Replaceability test:** Can competitors reuse it by swapping a name? If so, improve specificity when genuine differentiation is available; do not force novelty at the expense of clarity.
- **One revision pass:** Fix only the failed dimension. If critical buyer/offer facts are missing, ask for those facts instead of inventing a grander promise.

Do not publish extra pages, run A/B tests or alter existing customer sites from this process alone. Actual performance (queries, qualified leads and outcomes) can improve this single lab over time, without turning every research insight into a compulsory rule.
